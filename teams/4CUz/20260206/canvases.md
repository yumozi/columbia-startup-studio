**Lean Startup Canvas**

**Concept:** **Mood-aware scroll replacement for new grads during commutes**

**1. Problem**

**Top 3 problems:**

- Commute time feels wasted but is too fragmented for deep work (trains, buses, walking).
- Default behavior during commute is doomscrolling, which increases anxiety rather than relieving it.
- New grads lack a low-effort, emotionally safe alternative to social feeds.

**Current alternatives:**

- Instagram / TikTok / LinkedIn (high engagement, low emotional ROI)
- Podcasts (require sustained attention)
- To-do apps (ignored during commute)
- “Be productive” advice (misaligned with reality)

**Assumptions to validate:**

- New grads want a replacement, not just less guilt.
- Commute frustration is emotional, not just efficiency-based.

**2. Customer Segments**

**Primary user:**

- New graduates (21–26)
- First or second job
- Daily commute ≥20 minutes
- iPhone-first, heavy social media users

**Early adopters:**

- Self-aware doomscrollers
- Users already consuming career or mental health content
- Those expressing “I waste my commute” sentiment

**Assumptions to validate:**

- This pain is stronger in new grads than older professionals.
- iOS-only is acceptable initially.

**3. Unique Value Proposition (UVP)**

**“A calmer way to scroll—built for the emotional reality of early-career commutes.”**

**Why this is different:**

- Doesn’t ask users to “be productive”
- Doesn’t shame scrolling
- Optimized for fragmented attention and emotional regulation

**Assumptions to validate:**

- “Calmer scrolling” resonates more than “focus” or “productivity.”

**4. Solution**

**Core features (MVP-level):**

- Mood check-in (1 tap)  
    - Quick emotional selection (e.g., anxious, tired, numb).
- Mood-aware content feed  
    - Short-form content designed to stabilize, not stimulate.
- Commute-sized sessions  
    - 5–15 minute content arcs with a clear end.
- Gentle closure  
    - End each session with a grounding moment, not a cliffhanger.

**Out of scope (initially):**

- Habit streaks
- Heavy personalization
- Long-form content

**Assumptions to validate:**

- Users will actually check in with mood instead of skipping.
- Emotional relief beats novelty for retention.

**5. Key Metrics**

**Activation:**

- % of users completing first commute session

**Engagement:**

- Sessions per week (especially weekday mornings)
- Average session completion rate

**Value:**

- Self-reported anxiety before vs after session
- % of commutes without switching to social apps

**Retention:**

- Day 7 and Day 30 retention

**Assumptions to validate:**

- Emotional improvement correlates with retention.
- Users will self-report honestly.

**6. Channels**

**Primary acquisition:**

- TikTok & Instagram (ironically positioned as “anti-doomscroll”)
- University alumni mailing lists
- Early-career influencers

**Secondary:**

- App Store search (mental wellness, early career)
- Word of mouth among peers

**Assumptions to validate:**

- Users will download an app about scrolling while scrolling.
- Universities will share non-academic tools.

**7. Revenue Streams**

**Phase 1 (Consumer):**

- Freemium model
    - Free: 1 commute session/day
    - Paid ($4–6/month): unlimited sessions, deeper personalization

**Phase 2 (B2B2C):**

- Employer or university wellness bundles

**Assumptions to validate:**

- New grads will pay for emotional relief.
- Subscription beats one-time purchase.

**8. Cost Structure**

**Fixed costs:**

- iOS development
- Content creation (writers, psychologists, career coaches)
- Cloud infrastructure

**Variable costs:**

- User acquisition
- Content moderation
- Analytics and experimentation

**Assumptions to validate:**

- Content quality > content volume.
- Editorial approach scales better than pure UGC.

**9. Unfair Advantage**

- Emotional framing: treating doomscrolling as coping, not addiction
- Commute-native design (fragmented, repeatable, finite)
- Early emotional data on new-grad anxiety patterns
- Trust-based tone (no hustle culture, no toxic positivity)

**Assumptions to validate:**

- Emotional trust can become a defensible moat.
- Big social platforms won’t copy this framing quickly.

**Key Risk Summary (What to Test First)**

- Will users choose this over Instagram when tired?
- Does mood-aware content actually reduce anxiety measurably?
- Is this a daily habit or an occasional “reset” tool?
