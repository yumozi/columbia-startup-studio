## Step 3, Part 1: Library Seat Problems

**Persona:** College student, on phone, library, studying but can't find a seat

### 1. "Ghost Occupancy" Seats
- **Problem:** Half the library looks "full" because seats are claimed with laptops and jackets, but no one is actually there.
- **Why this persona cares:** They're already mentally switching into study mode. Walking around hunting for a seat breaks focus and spikes irritation.
- **Solution concept:** A lightweight app + QR tag on desks — seats auto-release after X minutes of no check-in. Claiming a seat requires a quick tap.
- **Pain likelihood:** 9/10 — every student has rage about this.

### 2. Decision Fatigue at the Door
- **Problem:** The student enters the library without knowing where seats are open, causing wandering and cognitive overload.
- **Why this persona cares:** They're already tired. Every extra decision reduces study motivation.
- **Solution concept:** A live heatmap of seat availability shown at the entrance + mobile view before arrival.
- **Pain likelihood:** 8/10 — extremely relatable, especially during midterms/finals.

### Designer Takeaway
This isn't just a space problem — it's a motivation, fairness, and cognitive load problem. The best ideas:
- Reduce uncertainty
- Prevent social friction
- Protect mental momentum

## Step 3, Part 2: Intern Housing Problems

**Persona:** College student, with phone/computer, new city for summer internship, looking for a place to live but doesn't have many connections to the new city

### 1. The "I Don't Know What Neighborhoods Mean" Problem
- **Problem:** The student sees listings but has no intuition for which neighborhoods are safe, social, boring, or isolated.
- **Why this persona cares:** A wrong neighborhood means loneliness, long commutes, or feeling unsafe — hard to recover from for a short internship.
- **Solution concept:** A neighborhood decoder that explains areas in student language: "good for interns," "quiet but isolating," "social but loud."
- **Pain likelihood:** 9/10 — extremely common and deeply stressful.

### 2. No Trusted Signal in Listings
- **Problem:** Every listing looks the same, and it's impossible to tell what's legit vs scammy.
- **Why this persona cares:** They can't tour in person and don't want to lose money or end up stranded.
- **Solution concept:** A trust-layer on top of listings: verified interns, alumni reviews, and proof-of-occupancy checks.
- **Pain likelihood:** 9/10 — fear of scams is huge.

### 3. The "I Just Want Normal Roommates" Problem
- **Problem:** They're not looking for best friends, just sane, compatible roommates — but have no social graph.
- **Why this persona cares:** Bad roommates can ruin a summer professionally and emotionally.
- **Solution concept:** Roommate matching based on daily rhythms (sleep, work hours, cleanliness), not personality quizzes.
- **Pain likelihood:** 8/10 — underrated but painful.

### 4. Short-Term Lease Dead Zone
- **Problem:** Most housing is 12 months, but internships are 8–12 weeks.
- **Why this persona cares:** They overpay or settle for bad options because of lease mismatch.
- **Solution concept:** A short-term lease exchange specifically for interns, co-ops, and visiting researchers.
- **Pain likelihood:** 8/10 — structural mismatch, very real.

### 5. Decision Paralysis from Too Many Tabs
- **Problem:** They juggle Zillow, Facebook groups, spreadsheets, and texts — no single source of truth.
- **Why this persona cares:** They're already onboarding at a new job; housing shouldn't be another full-time role.
- **Solution concept:** A unified "housing command center" that tracks listings, conversations, deadlines, and risks.
- **Pain likelihood:** 8/10 — cognitively exhausting.

## Step 3, Part 3: Busy Gym Problems

**Persona:** College student, on phone, gym, wants to start working out, the gym is very busy

### 1. "I don't know if I'm doing this exercise right"
- **Problem:** They copy others or vague memories from TikTok.
- **Why they care:** They don't want to get hurt or look stupid, especially in a packed gym.
- **Solution concept:** One-tap, 10-second silent demo videos optimized for in-gym use (no sound, no fluff).
- **Pain likelihood:** 9/10

### 2. "I don't know what to do when all the machines I planned to use are taken"
- **Problem:** Their workout plan collapses the moment 2–3 key machines are occupied.
- **Why they care:** As a beginner, improvising feels intimidating and embarrassing; they either wait around or leave early.
- **Solution concept:** A phone-based "swap instantly" feature — tap the blocked exercise → get 2–3 equivalent alternatives using currently less crowded equipment.
- **Pain likelihood:** 9/10
