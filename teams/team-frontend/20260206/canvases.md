## Lean Canvas: Short-Term Lease Dead Zone

### 1. Problem
- Standard leases are 12 months, but internships, co-ops, and research visits last 8–12 weeks
- Subletting is fragmented, informal, and risky (Facebook groups, word of mouth)
- Interns face overpriced, low-quality, or unsafe housing with little leverage

**Existing alternatives:**
- Airbnb (expensive, inconsistent, not community-oriented)
- Facebook / WhatsApp housing groups (chaotic, scam-prone)
- Corporate housing (limited, elitist, not scalable)

### 2. Customer Segments

**Primary:**
- College students on summer internships
- Visiting researchers (academia, hospitals, labs)
- Co-op students (rotational programs)

**Secondary:**
- Universities & research institutions
- Companies running large internship programs
- Tenants who leave apartments empty for summers

**Early adopters:**
- Interns moving to NYC, SF, Boston, Chicago, Seattle
- Students without family housing or financial buffers

### 3. Unique Value Proposition
> "Housing that matches your internship — not the other way around."

- Built specifically for short-term stays
- Trust + verification baked in
- Time-boxed, purpose-built, and predictable

### 4. Solution
A short-term lease exchange platform designed for 8–16 week stays.

**Listings are:**
- Verified (lease permission, identity, school/company)
- Time-locked to internship dates
- Transparent pricing (no Airbnb shock)

**Core features:**
- Match by dates, location, budget
- Intern-to-intern sublets + institution-approved listings
- Optional roommate matching (other interns nearby)

### 5. Key Metrics
- Listings posted per city per cycle
- Successful match rate
- Time-to-housing (days from search to lease)
- Repeat use (same user, new city)
- University / company partnerships signed

### 6. Unfair Advantage
- Network effects tied to internship cycles (summer = massive surge)
- Institutional trust (universities, hospitals, companies)
- Temporal advantage: people need housing by a deadline
- Could become the default intern housing layer, not just a marketplace

### 7. Channels
- University career centers
- Internship offer packets ("housing resources")
- Slack/Discord groups for interns
- Campus ambassadors
- LinkedIn + Reddit (city-specific intern threads)

### 8. Revenue Streams
- Small booking fee (split between host + renter)
- Institutional subscriptions (companies, universities)
- Premium listings for high-demand locations
- Optional insurance / guarantee add-ons

### 9. Cost Structure
- Platform development & maintenance
- Trust & verification (identity, lease permission)
- City launch + partnerships
- Customer support during peak seasons

### 10. Pain Likelihood
**8/10** — structural, recurring, and time-sensitive
- Happens every summer
- Affects tens of thousands of people
- Causes financial stress + bad living situations
- Current solutions are clearly misfit

## Lean Canvas: Decision Fatigue at the Door

### 1. Problem
- Students enter the library with no visibility into seat availability
- They wander floors, scan rooms, hover awkwardly, or give up
- This creates decision fatigue before studying even starts

**Current workarounds:**
- Walking every floor
- Asking friends / group chats
- Leaving and studying somewhere worse (or not at all)

### 2. Customer Segments

**Primary:**
- College students during midterms and finals
- Graduate students with limited time windows

**Secondary:**
- Libraries & campus facilities
- Universities focused on space optimization

**Early adopters:**
- Large campuses with crowded libraries
- STEM students pulling long hours
- First-years still learning campus spaces

### 3. Unique Value Proposition
> "Know where to sit before you even walk in."

- Removes friction at the exact moment motivation is fragile
- Turns uncertainty into a quick, confident decision
- Makes the library feel calmer and more humane

### 4. Solution
Live seat-availability heatmap displayed:
- At library entrances (large screen)
- On mobile before arrival
- Visual, glanceable, no login required

**How it works:**
- Sensors / Wi-Fi pings / check-in signals (implementation-flexible)
- Color-coded floors or zones (green → yellow → red)
- Optional filters: quiet, outlets, group seating

### 5. Key Metrics
- Average time to find a seat
- App / screen engagement at peak hours
- Reduction in "walk-outs"
- Repeat daily usage during exam weeks
- Library adoption rate across campus

### 6. Unfair Advantage
- Lives at the physical choke point (the door)
- High emotional leverage: solves a problem when users are already depleted
- Becomes habit-forming during stressful periods
- Data becomes valuable for facilities planning

### 7. Channels
- On-campus pilots with libraries
- Orientation & finals-week promotions
- QR codes at entrances
- Word-of-mouth ("just check the map")
- University IT / facilities partnerships

### 8. Revenue Streams
- University licensing (per building or campus-wide)
- Facilities analytics dashboards
- Sponsorships (coffee shops, campus services)
- White-labeled campus apps

### 9. Cost Structure
- Sensor infrastructure or data integration
- Hardware displays (entrances)
- Software development + maintenance
- Campus sales & implementation support

### 10. Pain Likelihood
**8/10** — universal, repeatable, emotionally salient
- Happens daily during peak weeks
- Small friction with outsized motivational cost
- Currently unsolved in most libraries
- Students instantly "get it"

## Lean Canvas: Gym Machine Taken — Instant Swap

### 1. Problem

**Core problem:** Beginner workout plans fail when 2–3 key machines or racks are occupied.

**Why this is painful:**
- Beginners don't know safe or effective substitutes
- Improvising in a crowded gym feels embarrassing and risky
- Waiting kills momentum; many cut workouts short or leave

**Existing alternatives:**
- Wait for the machine (wastes time, increases anxiety)
- Skip the exercise entirely
- Randomly pick another machine
- Google / YouTube mid-workout (slow, overwhelming)
- Ask someone (social friction)

**Assumptions to validate:**
- This happens frequently enough (≥1x per workout) to justify a product
- Leaving early or skipping exercises is common among beginners

### 2. Customer Segments

**Primary:**
- Gym beginners (0–6 months experience)
- Ages ~18–30
- Use shared, busy gyms (college rec centers, budget gyms)

**Early adopters:**
- College students with structured beginner programs
- People following plans from apps or influencers
- Users who already pull out their phone when stuck

**Secondary (later):**
- Travelers in unfamiliar gyms
- People returning after long breaks

**Assumptions to validate:**
- Beginners recognize "not knowing substitutes" as a real problem
- They're comfortable using their phone mid-workout

### 3. Unique Value Proposition
> "Your workout doesn't stop just because the gym is busy."

Instantly swap blocked exercises for safe, equivalent alternatives using available equipment.

**Why it's compelling:**
- Removes decision-making under social pressure
- Preserves workout structure and confidence
- Designed for live gym constraints, not planning at home

**Assumptions to validate:**
- "Instant swap" is more valuable than generic workout flexibility
- Beginners trust algorithmic substitutions

### 4. Solution

**MVP features:**
- **Blocked exercise input:** Tap or search the exercise you can't access
- **Instant substitution list:** 2–3 beginner-safe alternatives, same muscle group + movement pattern
- **Equipment-aware logic:** Bias toward dumbbells, cables, bodyweight; avoids rare or advanced machines

**Nice-to-have (later):**
- "Gym crowdedness" presets
- User feedback on swaps ("felt easy / hard")

**Explicit non-features (early):**
- Full workout programming
- Progress tracking
- Social sharing

**Assumptions to validate:**
- 2–3 options is the right number (not overwhelming)
- Beginners understand and trust "equivalent" exercises

### 5. Channels

**Acquisition:**
- TikTok / Reels: "POV: the machine you need is taken"
- Campus ambassadors
- Reddit beginner fitness threads
- App Store search ("gym machine taken")

**Activation:**
- First successful swap inside the gym

**Retention:**
- Repeated exposure to blocked equipment
- Habit of checking swaps instead of waiting

**Assumptions to validate:**
- Content-driven channels can reach beginners before they quit the gym
- First-use success leads to repeat behavior

### 6. Revenue Streams

**Initial:**
- Freemium: free limited swaps per week; paid ($4–7/month student pricing) for unlimited swaps + full library

**Future:**
- Bundling with beginner workout apps
- Licensing to gyms or universities
- B2B integrations

**Assumptions to validate:**
- Users hit swap limits often enough to upgrade
- The problem is painful enough to pay for

### 7. Cost Structure

**Main costs:**
- App development (iOS-first)
- Exercise equivalency logic design
- Basic content (exercise descriptions, visuals)
- Hosting & analytics

**Cost advantages:**
- No need for long videos
- Small, focused exercise set
- No real-time gym data required (initially)

**Assumptions to validate:**
- Manual equivalency mapping scales without high expert cost
- Users don't demand hyper-specific gym layouts early

### 8. Key Metrics

**Activation:**
- % of users who complete a swap in first session
- Time from app open → swap (<30 sec target)

**Engagement:**
- Swaps per workout
- Swaps per week per user

**Retention:**
- 7-day / 30-day retention
- % of users who report "finished workout as planned"

**Revenue:**
- Free → paid conversion
- Monthly churn

**Assumptions to validate:**
- Swap usage correlates with retention
- Swaps happen often enough to form a habit

### 9. Unfair Advantage

**Early advantages:**
- Clear focus on live gym constraints
- Beginner-first safety filters
- Simple mental model: "blocked → swap"

**Not defensible yet:**
- Exercise substitutions alone (copyable)
- Static logic without usage data

**Potential long-term moat:**
- Data on real-world substitution success
- Partnerships with gyms or beginner programs
- Trust as the "beginner-safe" standard

**Assumptions to validate:**
- Usage data meaningfully improves substitution quality
- Brand trust matters in fitness decision-making
