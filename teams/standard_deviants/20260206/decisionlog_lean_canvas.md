# *DecisionLog* — Lean Canvas

> **Decision Memory for Solo Builders**

---

## 01 · Problem

**Decision amnesia.** Builders forget the rationale behind their own past decisions within weeks.

They revisit settled decisions repeatedly, or reverse good ones because the original "why" is lost.

Existing tools (journals, docs, Notion) are too heavy — so nothing gets captured at all.

**Pain: 7 / 10**

---

## 02 · Solution

**One-paragraph "decision snapshots"** captured in <30 sec, tagged to a project.

**Auto-resurfacing:** snapshots surface when the related project comes back into focus (time-based or trigger-based).

**Decision timeline** per project — see the reasoning chain at a glance.

---

## 03 · Unique Value Proposition

**"Remember why you decided what you decided."**

Not a journal. Not a doc. A lightweight decision ledger that gives you back clarity months later — automatically.

*High-level concept: Git commit messages, but for business decisions.*

---

## 04 · Unfair Advantage

**Compounding data moat:** each logged decision makes the tool more valuable (network of rationale).

**Habit formation:** low-friction capture creates switching cost once established.

*Early: none. Must earn it through speed + taste in UX.*

---

## 05 · Customer Segments

**Primary:** Solo founders & indie hackers juggling 2-4 projects simultaneously.

**Secondary:** Small-team leads (2-5 people) who make decisions without formal processes.

**Early adopters:** Builders who already journal or use personal Notion — they feel the pain but lack a purpose-built tool.

*B2C → prosumer*

## 06 · Key Metrics

- **Activation:** ≥ 3 decision snapshots logged in first week
- **Retention:** Weekly active logging rate at Day 30
- **Aha moment:** First time a resurfaced snapshot prevents a re-decision
- **North star:** Decisions referenced back / month

---

## 07 · Channels

- **Content:** "Decision debt" blog posts, threads on X/Twitter targeting indie hacker audience.
- **Communities:** Indie Hackers, r/SideProject, Hacker News Show HN.
- **Integrations:** Slack / Telegram bot for frictionless capture.
- **Word of mouth:** Shareable decision timelines ("here's how I decided").

---

## 08 · Cost Structure

- **Infra:** Minimal — text-only storage, serverless functions.
- **AI/LLM:** Optional summarization & auto-tagging (API costs).
- **Founder time:** Primary cost in early stage.

*Target: <$200/mo burn to reach first 500 users.*

---

## 09 · Revenue Streams

- **Freemium:** Free tier (1 project, 50 snapshots). Enough to prove value.
- **Pro — $8/mo:** Unlimited projects, auto-resurfacing, AI-generated decision summaries, export.
- **Team — $12/user/mo:** Shared decision logs, async alignment, decision audit trail.

*Validate willingness to pay before building Team tier.*
