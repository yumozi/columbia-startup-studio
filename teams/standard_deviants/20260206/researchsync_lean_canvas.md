> **Version Control for Research Teams Who Won't Use Git**

---

## 01 · Problem

**No single source of truth.** Teams email "final_v3_REAL_updated_JK_edits.docx" with no way to know which version is current.

Someone inevitably overwrites someone else's work — edits are silently lost when a collaborator works from a stale copy.

The PI reviews an outdated draft, creating conflict and wasted effort across the entire team.

**Pain: 7 / 10**

---

## 02 · Solution

**Research-aware version control** — automatic merge tracking for Word docs and spreadsheets, no Git knowledge required.

**Plain-language change summaries:** "Dr. Kim updated Methods §3 and added 2 references" instead of raw diffs.

**One canonical link per document** — always opens the latest version; prior versions accessible via timeline.

---

## 03 · Unique Value Proposition

**"Google Docs meets a research-aware version control system."**

Never lose an edit. Never review a stale draft. Zero learning curve — works with the .docx and .xlsx files you already use.

*High-level concept: Git for people who will never open a terminal.*

---

## 04 · Unfair Advantage

**Deep research-workflow fit:** understands manuscript sections, citation metadata, and data-table conventions.

**Institution-friendly compliance:** on-prem / HIPAA / IRB-aware deployment that Google Docs and SharePoint can't match.

*Early: no moat. Must earn it through adoption density within departments.*

---

## 05 · Customer Segments

**Primary:** Academic research labs (3–15 people) — biomedical, social sciences, humanities.

**Secondary:** Clinical research organizations governed by IRB protocols that prohibit consumer cloud tools.

**Early adopters:** Frustrated postdocs and lab managers who currently serve as "human version control."

*B2B → institutional*

---

## 06 · Key Metrics

- **Activation:** % of invited collaborators who open a shared doc within 48 hrs
- **Retention:** Team still actively syncing at 90 days
- **Aha moment:** First auto-resolved merge conflict ("we just saved you from losing edits")
- **North star:** Merge conflicts auto-resolved / week per team

---

## 07 · Channels

- **Bottom-up viral:** One collaborator shares a link → the rest of the lab onboards itself.
- **Communities:** Academic Twitter/Mastodon, lab Slack groups, r/AskAcademia.
- **Conferences:** Demos at research-methods workshops and library science meetups.
- **Institutional:** University IT pilot programs and site-license procurement.

---

## 08 · Cost Structure

- **Engineering:** File-format parsing engine, merge logic, real-time sync infrastructure.
- **Compliance:** HIPAA / FERPA certifications, SOC 2 audits for institutional buyers.
- **Go-to-market:** Community building, conference presence, university partnership development.

*Compliance costs are the gate to institutional revenue — invest early.*

---

## 09 · Revenue Streams

- **Freemium:** Free for ≤3 collaborators on a single project. Enough to prove value within one manuscript cycle.
- **Team — $8/user/mo:** Unlimited projects, AI-generated change summaries, full version timeline, priority sync.
- **Institutional — annual site license:** Department-wide deployment, SSO, on-prem option, compliance reporting.

*Validate team-plan willingness to pay before investing in on-prem / enterprise tier.*
