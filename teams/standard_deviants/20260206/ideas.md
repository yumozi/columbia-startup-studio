## Combinations

- **Laptop + Columbia qualitative area PhD student + in Butler Library + trying to figure out logistic regression**

- **Laptop + qualitative research team member + at a team meeting + frustrated by the disorganization and repetition of work.**

- **Laptop + a financially conscious adult + trying to review their finances + wanting a better way to track, review, and view their financial situation**

- **Microinfluencer + Phone + Gym + Yoga:** Recording high-quality yoga content on a phone in a public gym is chaotic. Software needs to handle "cluttered" backgrounds and provide hands-free camera control via voice or pose detection.

- **Tablet + Nontechnical Undergraduate + in a crowded Cafe + attempting to clean a messy CSV for a class project.**

- **Phone + Builder / Field Researcher + at a noisy Lab bench + trying to log experimental observations without touching the device.**
